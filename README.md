# ☁️ Time Series Forecasting of Rivne Region Climate Characteristics

## 📊 Machine Learning Methods for Climate Data Analysis

---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project is dedicated to applying statistical and **Machine Learning (ML)** methods for the analysis and forecasting of time series data concerning key climate characteristics in the Rivne region, Ukraine.

The work serves as a research component focusing on the impact of global warming. The core outcome is the development of a predictive model capable of estimating future climate indicators.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

* **Data Preparation:** Collecting, cleaning, and performing initial analysis of historical climate data.
* **Time Series Decomposition:** Separating the data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
* **Modeling:** Implementing and comparing classic (ARIMA/SARIMA) and ML models (specifically, **Prophet** from Meta).
* **Visualization:** Creating clear visual representations of historical data, forecasts, and model performance metrics.
